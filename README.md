# Tyre_Pressure_Monitoring_System
<h3>
  Abstract:
</h3>

The Tyre Pressure Monitoring System which is used today indicates only
whether the air pressure in any of the tyres is below a particular level of safety. This
avoidable signal has made it possible for the statistical death rate to come up to 650
deaths per year. This project displays values through continuous monitoring.
Therefore, this research proposed a method to cumulate the various factors of the tyre
and to display it to the driver for a safer experience. The proposed TPMS has an
electronic device unit that is attached to the tyre and transmits the values of the
pressure, temperature, and the wheel alignment to the unit to be placed inside the
vehicle, observable to the driver. This unit includes pressure sensors, microcontrollers,
RF transmission, and batteries. An alert is introduced which indicates if the pressure
exceeds the maximum or minimum safe pressure level. Several experiments have been
carried out to analyze the proposed system. The integrated TPMS has proven to be an
effective alternative to maintain the tyres and aims to improve the comfort and safety
of the driver.

According to research, there is an increase in the number of accidents that take place due to the
carelessness drawn towards the low air pressure in tyres. In India alone, 35-40% of accidents that have
taken place, occur due to tyre bursts in the past 5 Years. Tyre blowouts are one of the most common
reasons for accidents that take place. T. Xiangjun, proposed [1] the event of a sudden flat tire
accounted for 49.81% of highway accidents, in 2006. N. N. Hasan, A. Arif, [2] et al proposed the
current tyre pressure sensors indicate a symbol in the dashboard of the car that people usually tend to
ignore. Currently, there are two basic methods to measure tire pressure; direct and indirect. The direct
technique is implemented but with the use of a differential pressure sensor. This project will ensure
that the driver will have the exact air pressures of all the tyres of the car displayed continuously. It also
deals with the wear and tear of the tyre. One more aspect of the project is the temperature and wheel
alignment of the car. When the car is driven in the most moderate conditions, there is greater longevity
of the tyres while simultaneously provides a smoother and safer drive. In the currently used products,
they aren't available for the wear and tear of tyres. However, through more research and technological
interventions, we're looking forward to this product displaying.

- Tyre pressure is measured and displayed constantly.
- The wheel alignment that will help in parking and keeping the tyres in an optimum condition
during parking.
- The temperature sensor that indicates the wear and tear of the tyre, along with the frictional
