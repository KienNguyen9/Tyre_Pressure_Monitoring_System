# Tyre_Pressure_Monitoring_System
<h3>
  Abstract:
</h3>

The Tyre Pressure Monitoring System which is used today indicates only
whether the air pressure in any of the tyres is below a particular level of safety. This
avoidable signal has made it possible for the statistical death rate to come up to 650
deaths per year. This project displays values through continuous monitoring.
Therefore, this research proposed a method to cumulate the various factors of the tyre
and to display it to the driver for a safer experience. The proposed TPMS has an
electronic device unit that is attached to the tyre and transmits the values of the
pressure, temperature, and the wheel alignment to the unit to be placed inside the
vehicle, observable to the driver. This unit includes pressure sensors, microcontrollers,
RF transmission, and batteries. An alert is introduced which indicates if the pressure
exceeds the maximum or minimum safe pressure level. Several experiments have been
carried out to analyze the proposed system. The integrated TPMS has proven to be an
effective alternative to maintain the tyres and aims to improve the comfort and safety
of the driver.
